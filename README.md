# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project involves using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering, to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to provide businesses with valuable insights into different customer types to help target marketing efforts and improve customer relations.

### Features:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Utilizes clustering techniques such as K-means to segment customers based on their characteristics.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzes and processes customer data to discover patterns.
- **Visualization**: Displays the resulting customer segments with visualizations like scatter plots and cluster centers.

### Files:
- **`Customer_Segmentation_using_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_in_Python.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where the segmentation model is built and executed.
- **`new.csv`**: The dataset used for customer segmentation, containing customer features (e.g., demographics, purchase data).

### Installation and Setup:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshika161/CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open the `Customer_Segmentation_using_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_in_Python.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells to build and evaluate the customer segmentation model.

### How to Use:
1. Load the `new.csv` dataset into the notebook.
2. Perform data preprocessing and cleaning, such as handling missing values and scaling features.
3. Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers into groups.
4. Visualize the segmentation results using plots and interpret the clusters.
5. Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment and draw insights.

### Testing:
You can run the code and adjust parameters like the number of clusters in the K-means algorithm. Modify the dataset or apply different clustering techniques to explore further.

### Project Structure:
- **`Customer_Segmentation_using_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_in_Python.ipynb`**: Contains the Python code for customer segmentation using unsupervised learning.
- **`new.csv`**: The customer dataset used for segmentation.
